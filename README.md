## about the pneumonia
#
### Pneumonia : 
- is an infection that inflames the alveoli in one or both lungs. The alveoli may fill with pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. In general, pneumonia is caused by a virus, a bacteria or fungi.
- Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.
- Chest X-Ray images can be useful in the diagnosis of Pneumonia. A doctor can diagnose it, know the extent and the location of the infection by looking at an X-Ray image withing a few seconds or minutes.
- The aim of this work is to automatize the detection of Pneumonia by using Deep Learning algorithms and only X-Ray images. Different techniques will be used in order to achieve the best possible results. If this task can be sucessfully achieved by a machine, then it will help doctors to save a lot of time that could be used in other actions.
### Symptoms :
- The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.
-
-  Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:
-  Chest pain when you breathe or cough
-  Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)
-  Cough, which may produce phlegm
-  Fatigue
-  Fever, sweating and shaking chills
-  Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)
-  Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
-  Shortness of breath
-  Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating.

### When to see a doctor :
- See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus.

- It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor:

-  Adults older than age 65
-  Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms
-  People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system
-  People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system
